# Risk Management at a Venture Capital Firm

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is that I am a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked me to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given me a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that predicts whether an applicant will become a successful business.

I reprocessed data for the neural network model, used the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model, and optimized the model.

I have created a Jupyter notebook containing my analysis, including text and comments to document my findings.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following modules:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For reading data into a DataFrame and analyzing data via statistics and plots.

* [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) - For reading and writing tabular data in CSV (Comma Seperated Values) format.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For representing the file system path to a csv.

* [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) - For running code across multiple platforms.

* [keras](https://keras.io/about/) - For building models.

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html#) - For machine learning.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html) - For embedding plots in the application.
